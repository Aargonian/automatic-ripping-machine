Automatic Ripping Mahcine (ARM) Project
Development Branch: dep-omdbapi-key

Scope: Add the ability to query omdbapi using thier new API key structure. As
    of late May 2017, a change in policy at omdbapi requires the use of a key
    to perform queries. At this time, it is undetermined whether free (as in beer)
    access will be made again available, but if it is, it appears that it will
    still require a key.
    
This branch will update the code making the queries to get movie by type, which
    is used by the ARM to determine whether a video disc is a "movie" or a
    "TV series," (or potentially any other type of video). 
    
Files affected:

config.sample -- will likely need a new variable to support the eu's API key,
    this will be modelled off the exisitng API key methodology used for existing
    keyed tools like pushbullet and (presumably) MakeMKV.
    
getvideotype.py -- primary python script that gets the video type.
